# bookbot
** Bookbot is one of my first git projects! ** 

This project takes in a text file and prints a report with 
a word count and a count for each individual letter.  The 
letters are sorted in descending count order.

This project was great!  It stretched my ability to 
think in terms of sorting and splitting text into 
manageable chunks.  The whole book of Frankenstein 
has been counted and sorted in a flash.
